`cycleRtools` is a package intended to open up the power of R to cyclists and those interested in cycling data. Functions are provided for reading raw data files into the R environment--a signficant barrier in any case--as well as several specialist functions that are provided by other, often proprietary platforms.

****

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(cycleRtools)
```

# Reading in data

For these examples we'll be using a preloaded dataset, named `intervaldata` (i.e `data(intervaldata)`). The corresponding Garmin .fit file is provided in the `extdata` directory of this package, tarballed together with other files of various formats. See `?read_ride` and the example therein.

Briefly, if `intervaldata.fit` is the file name, then this dataset was generated via:

```r
intervaldata <- read_ride("intervaldata.fit", format = TRUE,
                          CP = 310,  # Critical power.
                          sRPE = 7)  # Session RPE.
```

Note that `read_ride()` is a generic wrapper for all `read_*` functions in this package (`read_fit()`, `read_srm()` etc...) and calls the appropriate function according to file extension.

## CP and sRPE arguments

When these (numeric) arguments are supplied, they are associated with the parsed data and subsequently used by other functions in this package; they can also serve as useful records should the object be saved as part of ongoing training monitoring. They correspond to "**C**ritical **P**ower" and "**s**ession **RPE**", respectively. For more information on these metrics see Jones *et al.*, 2010 and Foster *et al.*, 2001.

## The 'cycleRdata' format

Calling any `read_*` function with the argument `format = TRUE` will generate a data.frame-type object of class `cycleRdata`. The creation of this class was deemed necessary so that certain columns could be assumed to exist in the data; thus ultimately making life more straightforward for the user. See `?cycleRdata` for details of the format.

# Exploring the data

It goes without saying that once these cycling data are within the R environment, endless analytical procedures become available. For the purposes of this demonstration, only some of those procedures facilitated by this package are shown.

## Visualising the data

As is customary, data should first be plotted. `cycleRdata` objects have an associated `plot` method:

```{r, fig.height = 10}
plot(x = intervaldata,     # "x" is the data, for consistency with other methods.
     y = 1:3,              # Which plots should be created? see below.
     xvar = "timer.min",   # What should be plotted on the x axis?
     xlab = "Time (min)",  # x axis label.
     laps = TRUE,          # Should different laps be coloured?
     breaks = TRUE)        # Should stoppages in the ride be shown?
```

The `y` argument for this `plot` method specifies the way in which the plot stack should be generated. Specifically `length(y)` determines the number of plots to be stacked, and the combination of `c(1, 2, 3)` controls what is plotted and where. As is described in `?plot.cycleRdata`, numbers in this argument give:

  1. A W' balance plot (Skiba et al., 2012).
  2. A power plot.
  3. An elevation plot.
  
So for example:

```r
plot(intervaldata, y = c(3:1))  # Inverts the above plot.
plot(intervaldata, y = 2)       # Just plots power.
plot(intervaldata, y = c(1, 3)) # W' balance over elevation.
```

Plots can also be zoomed, and the title metric will be adjusted accordingly.

```{r}
## Zoom to 0-50 minutes.
plot(intervaldata, y = 3, xvar = "timer.min", xlim = c(0, 50))
```


## Time in zones

Another want of cyclists is the ability to analyse "time in zones". This is provided primarily by the functions `zone_time()` and `zdist_plot()`.

### zone_time()

```{r}
zone_time(data = intervaldata,
          column = power.W,           # What are we interested in?
          zbounds = c(100, 200, 300), # Zone boundaries.
          pct = FALSE) / 60           # Output in minutes.

## How about time above and below CP, as a percentage?
## NB: column = power.W is the default.
zone_time(intervaldata, zbounds = 310, pct = TRUE) 
```

### zdist_plot()

```{r}
zdist_plot(data = intervaldata,
           binwidth = 10,               # 10 Watt bins.
           zbounds = c(100, 200, 300),  # Zone boundaries.
           xlim = c(50, 400))           # Zoom to 50-400 Watts.
```


## Summarising the data

`cycleRdata` objects have a `summary` method, which calculates common metrics and will produce a lap and/or interval summary as appropriate.

```{r}
summary(intervaldata)
```

Also see `?summary_metrics` for other common metrics.

### Power profiling

Best mean powers for specified durations can be generated via the `mmv()` function. This will return both the best recorded values, as well as when those were recorded in the ride (seconds).

```{r}
times_sec <- 2:20 * 60   # 2-20 minutes.
prof <- mmv(data = intervaldata, 
            column = power.W,    # Could also use speed.kmh.
            windows = times_sec)
print(prof)
```

This returns the usual, hyperbolic power-time profile.

```{r}
hypm <- lm(prof[1, ] ~ {1 / times_sec})  # Hyperbolic model.

## Critical Power (Watts) and W' (Joules) estimates
hypm <- setNames(coef(hypm), c("CP", "W'"))
print(hypm)

## Plot with the inverse model overlaid.
plot(times_sec, prof[1, ], ylim = c(hypm["CP"], max(prof[1, ])),
     xlab = "Time (sec)", ylab = "Power (Watts)")
curve((hypm["W'"] / x) + hypm["CP"], add = TRUE, col = "red")
abline(h = hypm["CP"], lty = 2)
legend("topright", legend = c("Model", "CP"), bty = "n",
       lty = c(1, 2), col = c("red", "black"))
```


### Pt_model()

More sophisticated modelling is provided by the `Pt_model` function; see `?Pt_model`. Briefly:

```{r}
ms <- Pt_model(prof[1, ], times_sec)
print(ms)

plot(times_sec, prof[1, ], ylim = c(hypm["CP"], max(prof[1, ])),
     xlab = "Time (sec)", ylab = "Power (Watts)")
## Showing an exponential model, as it best fits these data.
curve(ms$Pfn$exp(x), add = TRUE, col = "red")
```
