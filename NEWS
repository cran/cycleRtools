Changes in 1.0.4
	* Golden Cheetah (> v3.3) integration.
	* For rolling operations, arguments referring to window size are now more clearly
	  named ("window", or some variant thereof), as opposed to "pd". Improves readability.
	* "cycleRdata" objects now include cadence.
	* "XML" has been replaced with "xml2", due to better performance of the latter. The
	  relevant functions (read_pwx & read_tcx) will also make use of the "parallel" package
	  if available.
	* Crude command line functions (read_pwx2 & read_tcx2) have been removed as they lacked
	  portability.
	* XML data parsing can now handle missing "fields", hence the ".list" argument is no longer
	  needed.
	* More detail added to W' balance (?Wbal) documentation.

Changes in 1.0.3
	* Can now convert from seconds to "HH:MM:SS".
	* In addition to the above, time conversion functions are now also vectorised.

Changes in 1.0.2
	* New function for interval detection added: interval_detect(). An example
	  data set (`interval_data`) also added to compliment this change.
	* Removed ggplot dependency in zdist_plot() (formerly dist_plot()); now uses
	  base plot.
	* XML:: solution for reading Garmin .tcx files added.
	* Plotting functions improved; largely to make them more flexible.
	* Summary S3 method added for `cycleRdata` objects.
	* Added an argument to circumvent non-standard evaluation (`.string`).
	* Timestamps now retrieved from .srm files.
	* elevation_correct() now will only write to the working directory.

Changes in 1.0.1
	* Typo in Wbal() example corrected.

Changes in 1.0.0
	* First official version; released on CRAN.
