Changes in 1.1.1
  * Vignette index entry corrected.
  * `leaflet` package added to suggests and example added to vignette.
  * `testthat` tests aren't included in package build; see GitHub repo.

Changes in 1.1.0
  * Improvements to rolling operations. Rcpp function (`rollmean_`) now exported.
  * `read()` wrapper function renamed to `read_ride()` to avoid naming conflicts.
  * New function added for rolling over non-uniformly sampled data: `rollmean_nunif`.
  * Reading functions will now assign useful metadata (critical power & session
    RPE) to imports.
  * Summary method for `cycleRdata` objects improved.
  * Heart rate has been incorporated into the `cycleRdata` format.
  * `cycleRdata` objects are now specifically documented.
  * Rcpp function for calculating W' balance is now exported (`Wbal_`). Also see
    source code for closer inspection of the algorithm.
  * What was formerly Wbal_plots() is now the plot method for `cycleRdata` objects. The
    underlying function has been improved and new options added; see `?plot.cycleRdata`.
  * `.string` argument for evading NSE has been replaced with `character.only` for
    consistency with base functions.
  * `predict.Ptmodels` arguments are now more intuitive.
  * `read_pwx2` & `read_tcx2` no longer make use of the parallel package. This shouldn't
    have been used indiscriminately.
  * `xml2` is now imported, as functions are used repeatedly in `read_pwx2` & `read_tcx2`,
    hence there was potential for performance improvement from removing the `::` operator.
  * `uniform` function removed as it was likely to misbehave. Uniform sampling frequency
    is now an implicit assumption, and the replacement function `expand_stops` (unexported)
    should return an error if this assumption isn't met.
  * `mmv` no longer rounds its output--this should be left to the user.
  * Example data files added in "extdata" directory.
  * The example dataset `cycling_data` has been renamed to `ridedata` for brevity.
  * `interval_data` (now just `intervaldata`) updated.
  * Testing implemented via testthat.
  * Documentation and examples improved.
  * Vignette updated.

Changes in 1.0.4
	* Golden Cheetah (> v3.3) integration.
	* For rolling operations, arguments referring to window size are now more clearly
	  named ("window", or some variant thereof), as opposed to `pd`. Improves readability.
	* `cycleRdata` objects now include cadence.
	* `XML` has been replaced with `xml2`, due to better performance of the latter. The
	  relevant functions (`read_pwx` & `read_tcx`) will also make use of the "parallel" package
	  if available.
	* Crude command line functions (`read_pwx2` & `read_tcx2`) have been removed as they lacked
	  portability.
	* XML data parsing can now handle missing "fields", hence the `.list` argument is no longer
	  needed.
	* More detail added to W' balance (?Wbal) documentation.

Changes in 1.0.3
	* Can now convert from seconds to "HH:MM:SS".
	* In addition to the above, time conversion functions are now also vectorised.

Changes in 1.0.2
	* New function for interval detection added: interval_detect(). An example
	  data set (`interval_data`) also added to compliment this change.
	* Removed ggplot dependency in zdist_plot() (formerly dist_plot()); now uses
	  base plot.
	* XML:: solution for reading Garmin .tcx files added.
	* Plotting functions improved; largely to make them more flexible.
	* Summary S3 method added for `cycleRdata` objects.
	* Added an argument to circumvent non-standard evaluation (`.string`).
	* Timestamps now retrieved from .srm files.
	* elevation_correct() now will only write to the working directory.

Changes in 1.0.1
	* Typo in Wbal() example corrected.

Changes in 1.0.0
	* First official version; released on CRAN.
